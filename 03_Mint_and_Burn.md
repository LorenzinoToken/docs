# Mint & Burn Mechanics

## 🥐 Mint Strategy: controlled yeast

❌ No inflationistic mint\
Token fully minted at deploy (1B).

> "No longer rising, it is perfect like this"

## 🔥 Burn Strategy: token rapid digestion

#### ✅ Automatic deflationary burn

Each time $LORY is used 1% is burned = supply reduction -> rarer token -> more value.

**Application:**

NFT purchase? Burn 🔥\
DEX swap? Burn 🔥\
Community donation? Burn 🔥

> "With $LORY each transaction is a diet from inflaction."

#### ✅ Manual periodic burn

* Every 3 months
* Every community milestone
* Events
